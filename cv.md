## Summary
I work as a cheaf accountant and deputy director in private company. Our organisation provides outsourcing accountancy services. Unfortunately it took too long for me to realise that accounting is not perspective at all in our country.

I became a high-level specialist, but I don't like my present job any more. In accounting you are always study but you study just not to get some fine, other punishment or even not to get to jail! I just want to work in fresh developing sphere with cheerful interesting people. I want to get information that helps to do more useful job and provides opportunity to work more effective. 

I have a strong communication skills, a good skills in problem solving, I don`t fear a great responsibility, I have an ability to learn and improve my skills and I always get the job done.
